NAME: Calcium, inorganic phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels in elderly patients 
TYPE: Retrospective chart review 
SIZE: 178 records by 8 variables

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT: 
Each record contains the results of a laboratory analysis of calcium, 
inorganic phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase. The variable cammol 
is measured as millimoles per liter. Phosmol is inorganic phosphorous 
in millimoles per liter. Alkphos is meauring alkaline phosphatase in 
international units per liter. The purpose of the study was to 
determine if significant gender differences exist in the mean values 
of calcium, inorganic phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase in 
subjects over age 65. A second purpose was to determine if analytical 
variation between laboratoreis would affect the mean values of the study variables. 
Calcium.dat contains incorrect records that have transcription errors. Calciumgood.dat 
contains the corrected values.

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES: 
Have students use graphical and summary analysis techniques to discover 
"problem" values in calcium.dat. The file calciumgood.dat contains the 
corrected values. A full description of how to use this data can be found in the 
"Datasets and Stories" article "Teaching Students to Use Summary Statistics and 
Graphics to Clean and Analyze Data". To utilize the grid for obtaining 
psuedo patient records to learn the correct data values, click on
